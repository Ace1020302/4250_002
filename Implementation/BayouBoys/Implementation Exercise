Requirements
User input.
Count each instance of the characters.
Check if each character matches and ASCII character.
Print out message of top 3.
Print how many characters wasn’t detected.
Print string in reverse order.

DESIGN
Take a string and split string into multiple characters. (User Input).
Create VARIABLE1 and store each character in that array.
Create VARIABLE2 and store each character in that array.
In VARIABLE1 each instance of a character count. 
(Count each instance of the characters)
Sort characters in VARIABLE1 by their count “most to least”.
Print top characters with the three greatest counts. (Print top three characters).
Check each character and try to map it to an ASCII character. 
(Check if each character matches and ASCII character.)
If any, count each character that didn’t match. (Print how many characters didn’t detect)
Reverse the each character in that array VARIABLE2. (Print string in reverse order)






IMPLEMENTATION 
// get string
Input = ‘TestString’

//store string into two arrays so we can reverse one and use the other to sort
Variable1 = list(input)
Variable2 = list(input)

// creates empty dictionary to store character counts
Char_count = {}

//Iterate over each character in the array
For char in Variable1:

// Increment the count of the character in the dictionary
Char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) +1
