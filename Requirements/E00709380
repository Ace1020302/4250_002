Ball program functional:
- Canvas where the user can draw and the ball can move freely
- ball needs to bounce off of sides and of anything the user draws
- defined physics so that the user knows what to draw to make the ball go a direction
optional:
- Scoring mechanic. Maybe the ball has to hit a certain area of the wall and the less amount of pixels you use gets you score
- control of the ball based on user input
- differing levels of speed
- UI that shows score
- save game feature
Non-functional: 
- The program should be optimized and run at high frames
- the program should have accessibility features for the disabled
-  erase all drawings smaller then 3 pixels 
- work on a variety of OS
- Some way of keeping track of bugs and errors.
