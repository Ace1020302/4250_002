Requirements Exercise

Scenario 1
Try to write the requirements for a program that bounces a ball off the sides of the screen and any obstacles larger than 3 pixels the user draws with the mouse

Requirements:
•	There MUST be a ball that moves around the screen
    o	Functional
•	There MUST be a way for the user to draw
    o	Functional
•	The ball MUST bounce off the walls of the screen (all of the walls)
    o	Non-functional, maybe also functional *depends on if all the walls is a restriction*
•	The ball MUST bounce off user drawing’s bigger than 3 pixels
    o	Non-functional
•	It MIGHT need brushes for the user
    o	Non-functional, Optional

Information that is needed:
•	Is this going to be on the PC screen or a game window that is the size of the screen?
•	Is the user going to have to draw?
•	Does there need to be a menu of any type?
•	What does the user need to draw? Random shapes? Boxes? Circles?
•	Does the ball have gravity?
•	Does the ball need to have any sort of acceleration or other forces?
•	Does it need to bounce from all the walls or just some of them?
•	Is there a time requirement for this project? (Slide 13 of PowerPoint)

Potential Issues:
•	What happens when the user draws something inside the ball?
•	What happens when the user draws on top of a previous drawing.
•	What happens if the entire screen is covered in drawings?


 
Scenario 2
Try to write the requirements for simple arcade style driving game where the player has to navigate around obstacles to keep from crashing.

Requirements:
•	There MUST be vehicle for the player to drive
    o	Functional
•	There MUST be controls to drive the vehicle
    o	Functional
•	There MUST be obstacles that the player must avoid
    o	Non-Functional
•	Hitting the obstacles MUST have a consequence
    o	Non-Functional
•	There MAY be a menu to start the game
    o	Functional, Optional
•	The obstacles MIGHT move
    o	Functional, Optional

Information that is needed:
•	Is this going to be 2d or 3d? If 2d, vertical or horizontal?
•	What is the consequence for hitting an obstacle?
    o	Reduced health, game over, restart at checkpoint?
•	How long is the game? Infinity? Laps?
•	Should the obstacles move?
•	Power-ups?
•	What should be the controls? Should users define this?
•	Who is the target audience? (slide 12 of the requirements PowerPoint)

Potential Issues:
•	What happens when the player moves to the edge the screen? What about past it?
•	What happens when the player finishes? What about getting a game over?
•	Is this multiplayer? If so, what happens when two players collide?
