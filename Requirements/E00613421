Bouncing Ball Simulation

1. The program should display a ball that moves at a simulated velocity in a random initial direction on a computer monitor. (mandatory)

2. The program should display the ball bouncing off the edges of the screen at the appropriate reflection angle. (mandatory)

3. The program should accept input from the user through the mouse, allowing them to draw objects no less than 3 pixels in size. (mandatory)

4. The program should display the ball bouncing off of obstacles created through user input. (mandatory)

5. The program should simulate relatively appropriate physics for velocity and bouncing. (optional)

6. The program should work on a variety of displays, aspect ratios, and resolutions. (optional, non-functional)

7. If unexpected output occurs (mismatched screen resolution, error in physics simulation, etc), output to error log and exit gracefully. (optional, non-functional)

8. Could be part of an educational physics simulator if additional functionality and better simulation is added (optional, nonfunctional).
