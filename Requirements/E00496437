		○ What platform is this for? (mobile, desktop, web)
		○ How many shapes is the user allowed to draw?
		○ Do the shapes disappear after a certain time?
		○ Is the user's mouse cursor default for their system, or will it be a custom cursor?
		○ What color is the ball?
		○ Are the colors of the shapes randomized?
		○ Are the shapes stationary?
		○ Will the user see a background, or blank space?
		○ Is the user finished with drawing the shape when the beginning connects with the end, or is it finished when the user lets go of the mouse click?
		○ Is this going to be a game or screensaver/continuously running program?
