â€¢	Try to write the requirements for simple arcade style driving game where the player has to navigate around obstacles to keep from crashing.

Requirements: 

Mandatory:  

Player must stay inside outer boundaries or crash
Crash involves a temporary slowdown (10% speed for 2 seconds)
Obstacles are considered passable (when crash, you can pass through them)
Player chooses between 3 bodies of vehicle, car, truck, motorcycle, with 3 color options for each
Controls include : braking, acceleration (or going), shifting up, and shifting down
Course is procedurally generated, wide boundaries, obstacles 


Optional:  
                                     
Obstacles can be two types : passable, and impassable
Holding brake can reverse the vehicle                                     
Different difficulties : mumber of obstacles in seed, tighter / narrowing / expanding boundaries
Number of crashes adjusts vehicle display (wear and tear)
