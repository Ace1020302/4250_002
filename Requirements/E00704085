1. Bouncing Ball Game 

Program must generate balls at random intervals 

Balls can be various colors 

Balls can be various sizes 

Balls can have a random initial speed 

Balls can have a maximum speed 

There can be at most 10 balls on the screen at once 

Program must allow user mouse input to draw shapes of at least 3 pixels in size 

Program must detect collision with sides of screen 

Program must detect collision with user-drawn shapes 

Ball must speed up after each collision until reaching the maximum set speed 

Ball must explode once it reaches a max speed 

Assumptions: Objects drawn by the user do not need to be completed for collision to be detected. This prevents a user drawing from being rendered while inside a ball. Also, if a user attempts to draw onto a ball directly, the drawing will simply be ignored.
