Problem: Take in a string (from a user or a file), 
compute the total number of occurrences of each character in the ASCII set. 
Print out the top three characters (with the most occurrences). 
Print out how many characters in the ASCII set you didn’t detect. 
Then print out the string in reverse order.






First step- take a string from user or a file
Second step- count number of each char in ASCII
Third step- Print/display top 3 characters (with most occurrences)
Fourth step- Print/display char that didn’t detect.
Fifth step- Print string in reverse order. 

ASCII control char (0-31 and 127)
ASCII printable characters (32-126)
Extended ASCII characters (128-255).

Equation: 
There only certain amount of printable characters. (128)
Count characters that you found- characters you detected.
